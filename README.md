Batbot Machine Learning Codes and Jetson TX-2 Setup

This repository uses gitflow. 

When creating a new feature for the BatBot, create a feature/YOUR_FEATURE branch

When the feature is complete, merge the feature branch into the develop branch

With each new version, we will merge to the master branch

master <- develop <- feature
